# ComfyUI-APGScaling
ComfyUI nodes to use [APG scaling](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02416) for CFG, allowing for better image quality with higher CFG.

## Examples
See `example_workflows` directory for examples.

The following examples were made with SDXL Vanilla with CFG set to 15.0

Left image is without APG and right image is with APG on default settings.
